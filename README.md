# optimization based robot control

Includes assignments related to:
* Comparison between Operational Space Control (OSC), Impedence Control (IC), and Inverse Kinmeatics Iverse Dynamics (IKID)
* Use Differential Dynamic Programing (DDP) to control a double pendulum with under-actuation condition. Methods used to account for under-actuation were selection matrix and additional penalty.

Includes labs related to:
* Reactive Controls [Joint Control, Operational Space Control, Inverse Kinematics, Impedence Control]
* Optimal Controls [Differential Dynamic Programing, Numerical Integration methods, Single Shooting]
* Reinforcement Learning [Policy Evaluation, Policy Iteration, Value Iteration, Q_learning, Sarsa]
